				<h4>Sharing this information</h4>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>Credit or debit card payments will be collected by our payment processor.</li>
					<li>We do not store credit card numbers or CVV/CVV2 security numbers on our servers.</li>
					<li>We have the facility to re-charge a payment source at a later date for recurring bookings, cancellation fees and other payments that need to be taken to enable the smooth running of the Website.</li>
					<li>In order for payments to be processed, you may need to provide some necessary details to our payment processing agent(s). We tell you about this at the point we collect that information on the Website and the App.</li>
					<li>We may transfer your personal information to a third party as part of a sale of some or all of our business and assets to any third party or as part of any business restructuring or reorganisation, but we will take steps with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected.</li>
					<li>We may share your personally identifiable information with third parties solely for the purpose of providing the Save-O service to you. If we do this, such third parties' use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy.</li>
					<li>We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform and browser types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for the Website and the App.</li>
					<li>We may allow third party ad servers or ad networks to advertise on the Website and the App. These third party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser or app, the advertisements and links that appear on the Website and the App. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as “cookies”) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.</li>
					<li>Other than as set out above, we will not disclose any of your personal information without your permission unless we are required by law to do so (for example, if required to do so by a court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime).</li>
					<li>Information automatically collected from your computer: Log files/IP addresses. When you visit the Website and the App our web server automatically records your IP address.

					<li>Cookies. When you visit the Website and the App we may store some information (commonly known as a "cookie") on your computer. Cookies are pieces of information that a Website transfers to your hard drive to store and sometimes track information about you. Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other servers, which means that they cannot be used to track your movements around the web. Passwords and credit card numbers are not stored in cookies. A cookie helps you get the best out of the Website and the App and helps us to provide you with a more customised service. We use cookies for the following purposes:</li>
					<ol type="i">
						<li>Storing your login details so you don’t need to enter your login again if you haven’t logged out;</li>
						<li>Storing details about your Website preferences (for instance, where you are based);</li>
						<li>Storing details about any locations you have viewed;</li>
						<li>Enabling our web server to track your session between pages of the Website and the App and provide a continuity of experience.</li>
						<li>You can block or erase cookies from your computer if you want to (your browser's help screen or manual should tell you how to do this), but certain parts of the Website and the App are reliant on the use of cookies to operate correctly and may not work correctly if you set your browser not to accept cookies.</li>
					</ol>
				</ol>
				<h4>Other Websites</h4>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other Websites even if you access them using links from the Website and the App and recommend that you check the policy of each Website you visit and contact its owner or operator if you have any concerns or questions.</li>
					<li>In addition, if you linked to the Website and the App from a third party Website, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners or operators of that third party Website and recommend that you check the policy of that third party Website and contact its owner or operator if you have any concerns or questions.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>Security</h4>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>Save-O takes the privacy of personal information seriously. As such, we store personal information in a secure manner where access is restricted to prevent loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure within our systems.</li>
					<li>We use SSL technology to encrypt sensitive data transfer, and we recommend that you maintain a strong and confidential password for your account at all times.</li>
					<li>We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Save-O (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</li>
					<li>Save-O cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. We take commercially reasonable efforts in accordance with this Privacy Policy to ensure the security of our systems.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>Changes to this Policy</h4>
